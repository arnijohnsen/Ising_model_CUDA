## Numerical calulations on the Ising model using CUDA C
In this repository are programs used for numerical calculations of an anisotropic Ising model, written in CUDA C. 

Each directory contains one source file and one makefile.   
/vars2d: Calculates the mean value and variance for a 2d-grid, for a large predefined set of parameters  
/vars3d: Calculates the mean value and variance for a 3d-grid, for a large predefined set of parameters  
/grid2d: Prints the state of a 2d grid after some iterations, for a small predefined set of parameters  
/grid3d: Prints the state of a 3d grid after some iterations, for a small predefined set of parameters  

Created as a part of a final project in Physics at the University of Iceland.
